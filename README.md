MIDTERM

This project contains three fully implemented C++ console programs designed to practice user input handling, conditional logic, calculations, and formatted output using manipulators such as setw, setfill, fixed, showpoint, and setprecision.

Each program is stored as its own .cpp file and includes clear comments for readability and maintainability.

Problem 1: Tech Store Invoice Calculator

This program allows a customer to calculate their invoice at a fictional tech store.
The user is prompted for:

Customer name

Number of items purchased

Price per item

Store membership status (Y/N)

The program calculates:

Subtotal

Tiered discounts (10% over $500, 5% over $300)

Additional 5% membership discount

Final total after all discounts

Output is formatted clearly using alignment and precision formatting.

Problem 2: College Admission Eligibility Checker

This console application determines whether a student qualifies for admission to a fictional college.
The user provides:

Student name

High School GPA

SAT score (out of 1600)

Participation in extracurricular activities (Y/N)

Admission is granted if:

GPA ≥ 3.5 and SAT ≥ 1200
OR

GPA ≥ 3.0 and SAT ≥ 1000 and participated in extracurriculars

The program then displays a formatted results section including the decision and the reasoning behind it.

Problem 3: Grade Analyzer and Final Letter Grade

This program calculates a student’s final course average based on three major assignment scores.
After inputting the scores (each 0–100), the program:

Computes the final average

Determines the letter grade using a +/– grading scale (A+ through F)

Displays a formatted grade report

Output uses consistent formatting, alignment, and precision.
